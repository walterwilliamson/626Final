Meeting Notes 3/20:
- Have a working one layer model, after removing second layer predictions seems to work

Next Steps:
- Read/learn about keras, especially adding multiple layers (This week)
- Make predictions for the training set to test accuracy (DONE)
- Scale/normalize outputs before prediction, and then unscale/untransform for interpretation (to make sure we don't get negative survival times) (This week)
- Add more features (clustering of cells, etc.), could do more research on particularly informative proteins for example
- Hyperparameter selection process
